# cloudflared
Cloudflared is a project that configures your computer to run Cloudflare DNS, which can make your WiFi faster no matter where you have WiFi. Cloudflare is a content delivery network (CDN) that has a global network of servers. When you use Cloudflare DNS, your computer's DNS requests are routed through Cloudflare's servers. This can help to speed up your web browsing by reducing the distance that your DNS requests have to travel.

In addition to making your WiFi faster, Cloudflared also provides a number of other benefits, such as:

Increased security: Cloudflare's DNS servers are protected by a number of security features, which can help to protect your computer from malware and other attacks.
Improved privacy: Cloudflare does not track your DNS requests, which means that your browsing history is not stored by Cloudflare.
Easy to use: Cloudflared is a simple to use tool that can be installed on any computer.
If you are looking for a way to make your WiFi faster and more secure, then Cloudflared is a great option. To learn more about Cloudflared, please visit the project's website: https://github.com/cloudflare/cloudflared
